# DailyProgrammer-Challenges
Reddit - DailyProgrammer Challenges 1 - 4

To test my skills in c++ i looked for the internet for some chaellenges to work on. I discovered a 
sub-reddit called Daily Programmer and they post challenges regularly for programmers to test their
abilites. The challenges are broken up into 3 levels of difficulty - Easy, Intermediate and Difficult.
Currently i am opting for the easy challenges as I am only a novice to programming. Challenge #1 was 
posted in 2015 and has subsequently archived so you cannot post or comment on the older challenges, but
they are still being updated regularly with challenges currently standing at #321.

Its a good opportunity to learn in a more focused was I find. Currently I am learning from books and
there is only so many examples they can cover.

I would highly recommend Daily Programmers @ https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/
