# DailyProgrammer-Challenges
Reddit - DailyProgrammer Challenges 1 - 4

To test my skills in c++ i looked on the internet for some chaellenges to work on. I discovered a 
sub-reddit called Daily Programmer and they post challenges regularly for programmers to test their
abilites. The challenges are broken up into 3 levels of difficulty - Easy, Intermediate and Difficult.
Currently i am opting for the easy challenges as I am only a novice to programming. Challenge #1 was 
posted in 2012 and has subsequently been archived so you cannot post or comment on the older challenges,
but they are still being updated regularly with challenges currently standing at #322.

Its a good opportunity to learn in a more focused was I find. Currently I am learning from books and
there is only so many examples they can cover.

I would highly recommend Daily Programmers @ https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/
